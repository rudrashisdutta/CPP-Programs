# `CPP PROGRAMS`

---

##

## `ABOUT`

This repository contains almost all the `basic` programs that I have created using CPP. It also includes the programs from my [University](https://kiit.ac.in/) LABS, and the ones I practiced or tested certain things on.

##

## `PLATFORM AND COMPILER USED`

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Editor was used to create these programs.
MinGW GCC compiler was used

##

## `Instructions`

The [.vscode](PRACTICE/.vscode/) folder present inside the PRACTICE directory, can be used in case editing on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and using [MinGW GCC and G++ Compiler](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download) `Version 9.2.0`. In case using a different version, change the version or the compiler location in the file [C_CPP_PROPERTIES.json](PRACTICE/.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json). You must copy the [.vscode](PRACTICE/.vscode/) folder to a directory, if you wish to run a file present in it.
